Analysis of Flu season and hospital staff requirement in USA using Excel and Tableau
(Analysis performed for learning purposes with CareerFoundry educational platform)

Project Goal

To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics
and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza
season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will
examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for
staffing needs across the country.

Overview

The motivation behind the project is that The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
staff.Main objective is to determine when to send staff and how many to each of the 50 States.

During this project about flu season in the United States, I had a chance to expand on Excel analytical functions and work on visualizations in Tableau Public.
The data about demography(Population), Influenza deaths, Influenza tests,flu shots and doctor’s visits were collected in 5 separate sets.
Sources of the data are US Census Bureau and CDC.

In the very beginning of project , I started translating business requirements into clarifying and funnel questions from data perspective that guide me through the aanalysis.
Then I created project plan including stakeholder communication, schedules and Milestones, defined project deliverables.

Further I explored the datasets, understood the contents,data collection method figured out the data source - External or Internal, main variables in all the data that helped me in getting an idea, which data sets are most relevant for my analysis purpose.
After the understanding of data, I started data profiling by checking for Data Integrity, Data Accuracy and Data Consistency for the purpose of further Analysis. Here I used various excel tool like sorting, filtering, Pivots, Visulaization and various statistical functions.
Once the Data profiling was done , I performed all the data quality checks which involved looking for missing and duplicate data and fixed the issue for all the datasets using Excel functions and Pivot table.


In this project I worked mostly with Population Census and Influenza Mortality datasets.Since data was spread between two sets,I needed to map variables and perform many steps to transform the data using V-Look ups and Pivot.
Then, I was able to integrate the sets and look for a correlation between selected variables. Finally I was able to conduct inferential statistical analysis where I learned how to turn 
how to turn my research hypothesis into a testable statistical hypothesis by creating the null hypothesis, calculating the significance level, and interpreting the p-value, 
Also I learned how to run a t-test in Excel and interpret the p-value in relation to significance level to determine whether or not we can reject null hypothesis.
In this study case, I rejected the null hypothesis and confirmed my research hypothesis.

The second part of the influenza project concentrated on to draw insights from the same Influenza data using  data visualization techniques  of Tableau. 
I created composition & comparision charts( Pie, Bar, Column, Tree Map), temporal, spatial, and textual charts. Since the scope of the project required looking for insights to 
prepare for the next season, I also generated a forecast.I also created some Statistical visualization like histogram , Box Plots,scatter plots and bubble charts to look at the distribution of variable and correlation betweeen different variables.
In Tableau’s dashboard, I produced a report with my findings along with recommendations and video-recorded the insights for the stakeholders.
